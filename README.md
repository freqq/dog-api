# Dog API

Things to improve (not included in task therefore not implemented):

- Maybe some kind of pagination
- Filtering (by text?)
- Use redux or any more complexed state management library (for this kind of small app it would be a huge over engineering)
- Much more and better styling (ðŸ™„) but i didn't focus on it at all in this project
- RWD
